# hack-challenge

This backend application is modeled after a to-do list of tasks, which helps us keep track of different items we need to do / check off. For the backend, we separate to-do tasks by their categories (such as education, sports, etc), and we implement 4 routes in order to either get all categories, create a category, delete a category, and add a task (to-do) to a category.
